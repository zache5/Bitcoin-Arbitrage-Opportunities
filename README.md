# Bitcoin-Arbitrage-Opportunities
The purpose of this project is to identify the different opportunities for Bitcoin Arbitrage between the datasets from Coinbase and Bitstamp. This was a big technique for traders back during 2015-2019, and it allowed for traders to profit off of the different of close prices from the different exchanges.

## Technologies
In this code, I am using Pandas, pathlib, and matplotlib inline.

## Installation Guide
Pandas: import pandas as pd
Pathlib: from Pathlib import Path
Mathplot: %matplotlib inline

## Usage
This is used to chart different time frames from the datasets, and assess when the Arbitrage trades would have been profitable and when they would not have been. I have multiple examples of charts from different time frames throughout the dataset, as well as the profit that I would have made from the trades on specific days.
